# Assignment 7: Project - Full Stack Development

Welcome to Assignment 7 of the Technology Skill Development Lab (TSDL) Java course. This assignment focuses on full-stack development, integrating front-end and back-end technologies to build a complete web application.

## Project Description

This assignment involves the development of a payroll management system using Java for the back-end logic and MySQL for database management. The project includes features such as adding new employees, updating salary details, calculating monthly pay, and managing allowances and deductions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **PayrollSystem.java**: Contains the main class for the payroll management system. It includes methods for adding new employees, updating salary details, calculating monthly pay, and managing allowances and deductions.
- **MySQL Database Setup**: The project assumes the existence of a MySQL database named "payroll" with appropriate tables and schema. Ensure that MySQL is installed and running on your local machine, and update the database connection details (URL, username, password) in the code accordingly.

## Getting Started

To get started with Assignment 7, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the TSDL-java repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tagging-danger/TSDL-java.git

2. **Navigate to Assignment 7**: Once cloned, navigate to the Assignment 7 directory:

    ```bash
    cd TSDL-java/assignment\ 7

3. **Review Instructions**: Read the instructions provided in the README.md file within the Assignment 7 directory. It will contain details about the project requirements and any additional resources required.

4. **Run the Application**: Compile and run the PayrollSystem.java file to execute the payroll management system. Ensure that MySQL is running and the database connection details are correctly configured.
